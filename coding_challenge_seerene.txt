Restaurant Listing

The app you create should show users a list of restaurants plus details. Only
authenticated users shall have edit capabilities. Technology-wise, you are
required to use Python as the programming language. You are free to use any
frameworks and packages you prefer.



Here are the other details you might require:

* There must be a default view for non-logged in users. This would show a list
  of the restaurants.

* Filtering should be enabled, e.g. to only list restaurants that match a
  certain filter criteria.

* A user in the system would typically be the admin for an entity and on logging
  in, could edit that entity.

* You should implement a test-suite (both unit-tests and api-tests)


If you are adept at front end, you can also make a client with any javascript
framework to see this working.

Please provide the result as a zipfile containing a git repository with this
content:


1. The project with all source files

2. A short text document that lists the main steps of building your solution as
   well as all assumptions/decisions you made in case of unclear requirements or
   missing information
